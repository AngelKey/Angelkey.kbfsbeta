## KBFS

This repository contains beta source code and releases for the Keybase filesystem (KBFS) and service.

**Warning**: This is a temporary and experimental repository, and will
  be removed in the future.  The code in this repository does not
  represent a finalized architecture and we will probably not accept
  any external pull requests.  We advise you not to fork this
